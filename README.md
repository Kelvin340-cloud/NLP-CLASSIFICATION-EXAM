To fit a logistic regression model on training data after transforming it with polynomial features, follow these steps: First, generate synthetic data for binary classification using make_classification with appropriate parameters ensuring the sum of informative, redundant, and repeated features is less than the total number of features. Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split. Apply polynomial features using PolynomialFeatures with a specified degree (e.g., 2) to create interaction terms. Then, initialize a logistic regression model and fit it on the polynomial-transformed training data using fit_transform. Lastly, make predictions on the test data by transforming it with the same polynomial features and using predict. Ensure to handle any errors related to feature composition before proceeding with the training and evaluation of the model
